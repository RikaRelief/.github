<!-- ## Hi there üëã -->

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Introduction

Greetings, since you are looking at this we guess you are interested in what our little organization is all about. Three words; Mathematics, Programming
and Problems. Now what do those have to do with what we want to accomplish here? In short, we want to use a rich mixture of mathematics, programming and
computers to solve problems plaguing our community. The name of the organization gives a clue as to what particular problem we are solving currently, the
problem of relief and in particular, how do we use peer actors in the pursuit of the solution? This is a rather hard problem but we believe that with your
help and the tools available from the realm of mathematics and programming we will prevail. Now that we have given you a brief overview of what you might
expect from this organization you can look around and see what catches your eye and start helping.
